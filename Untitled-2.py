IT FEELS LIKE I'M BEING GROUND DOWN, LIKE I'M BEING THRASHED AROUND. I'M TIRED, AND IN THE PLACE I LOVE MOST.
I'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR A JOB, TRYING TO LIMIT MY APPLICATIONS I'M INTERESTED IN, BUT NONE OF THEM SEEM INTERESTED IN ME. THIS HURTS MUCH MORE THAN BEING REJECTED FROM PLACES WHERE I'M LESS INTERESTED/INVESTED IN THE WORK THEY ARE DOING. THE WORLD IS TELLING ME THAT I'M NOT GOOD AT THE THINGS I ENJOY.
I HURT MY SHOULDER. MARVIN IS NOT DOING WELL. MONEY FEELS TIGHT. SIEVVY FEELS HOPELESS. I DIDN'T GET INTO THE MASTER'S PROGRAM. I'M SO CONFUSED ABOUT THE CURRENT STATE OF THE JOB I (ALMOST?) GOT. MY PARENTS ARE GETTING SEPARATED.
MY NEW POTENTIAL-MAYBE-IS-IT-REALLY-HAPPENING-EMPLOYMENT TERMS THAT I'M DEFINING SEEMS LIKE A FAT GAMBLE. A WAY TO PRETEND LIKE I'M DOING THE RIGHT THING, BECAUSE IN THE MOST UNLIKELY SCENARIO, I WILL MAKE A GOOD DEAL MONEY. I HATE THE RAT RACE, BUT ONLY BECAUSE I'M NOT WINNING. I FEEL LIKE I'M NOT SMART ENOUGH, BUT I ALSO FEEL LIKE I AM.
I WANT TO PROGRAM CREATIVELY. I HAVEN'T DONE THAT IN A WHILE. THIS SECRET SECTION IS A BIT OF THAT DESIRE FINALLY MAKING ITS WAY OUT.
I'VE GOTTEN THRASHED BEFORE, BUT THIS FEELS WORSE. SLOWER. LIKE A MILL.
